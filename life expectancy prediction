#A Multiple Regression Model must meet 6 assumptions for it to be reliable and viable. When assumptions are violated a model loses its viability (Candace Flatt, Ronald L. Jacobs, 2019). 
#The first assumption is that the Relationship between dependent and independent variables are linear and additive:
#A straight line relationship is required between two variables for the linearity assumption to be fulfilled. 
#The pairs() function in R produces a matrix of scatterplots to inspect linearity after reading in the data.
#The Red lines the scatterplot shows linearity between the variables.

first<-lm(LE~TFR+MORT+TFR*MORT,data=female, na.action = na.omit) #Then the initial regression is done using both predictors and their product to test for interaction between the predictors.
